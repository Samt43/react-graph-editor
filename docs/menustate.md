MenuState
===============
- `open: boolean`:
    Whether the menu is open.
    You shouldn't normally have to read this value, as the Graph component will
    not render the Menu if it's closed.

- `x: number`:
    The x coordinate of the Menu in the viewport
- `y: number`
    The y coordinate of the Menu in the viewport

- `maxWidth: number`
    The maximum width this Menu can expand to before overflowing the viewport
- `maxHeight: number`
    The maximum height this Menu can expand to before overflowing the viewport
