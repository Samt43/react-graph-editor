The React Graph Editor API is divided into two main interfaces:
- The [Component](https://github.com/leops/react-graph-editor/tree/master/docs/component.md) API controls the actual rendering and styling of the editor
- The [State](https://github.com/leops/react-graph-editor/tree/master/docs/state.md) API controls the user's interactions with the editor
